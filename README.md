# COMP3100 (Distributed Systems) - Stage 2
### Introduction

COMP3100 Stage 2 requires the implementation of a custom algorithm that is optimised for turnaround time, whilst still maintaining balanced performance metrics.

### Usage
---

- Open a terminal and run ```./startServer.sh``` to start ds-sim server (you can edit the script to change which configuration file is used, they can be found in ```ds-sim > configs > sample-configs```).
- Open a second terminal and run ```./startClient.sh``` to start the java client.
- It will pop up asking you which algorithm you would like to choose, for stage 2 please enter ```ott``` for optimised turnaround time.

**_NOTE_**: Use ```sudo chmod +x startServer.sh``` or ```sudo chmod +x startClient.sh``` if either script does not execute.
