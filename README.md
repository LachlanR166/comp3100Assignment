### Introduction

COMP3100 Stage 2 requires the implementation of a custom algorithm that is optimised for turnaround time, whilst still maintaining balanced performance metrics.

### Usage
---

- Open a terminal in the directory and enter ```chmod +x givePermissions.sh``` and then enter ```./givePermissions.sh``` to give execute permissions to all the scripts.
- You can then type ```./runStage2Test.sh``` and press enter.
- It will ask which algorithm type you want to use, for this demonstration, type ```ott``` (all lower case) and press enter.
- The test will run and the results will be displayed at the end.
